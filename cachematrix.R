## When computing a matrix's inverse, these 2 functions can help
## check whether this inverse had already been calculated.
## If so one of these functions search this inverse 
## in cache, and return the inverse directly.
## If not, the same function will calculate the inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache 
## its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already
## been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then 
## cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cachesolve <- function(x, ...) {
        s <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(s)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(s)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        s <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(s)
        s
}
